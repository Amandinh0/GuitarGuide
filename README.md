A program that returns the notes in any of the 12 notes' major or minor chords and scales.

There are 12 widely used notes in music

This program uses 1d arrays to store these 12 notes

Scales and Chord notes fall under within these notes with a certain pattern of 

whole steps(2 notes from current note) and half steps(1 note from current note)

This program:
- Gets a note from the user
- Asks the what they want (major scale, minor scale, major chord, minor chord)
- Creates a new array of scales why transversing through the 12 notes using algorithms
- Displays the notes in the scale
- Uses the array of scale to create a chord
